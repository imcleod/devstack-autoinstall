# Replace with a private/secondary interface name
# Many documents suggest making this identical to the interfaces above
# In my experience this results in default network Nova hosts being network isolated
# I believe this is a result of the FLAT and PUBLIC ethernet segments overlapping
# TODO: I have seen reference to explicitly setting FLAT_INTERFACE to v100, which is the
#       private IP space bridge.  This should accomplish the same thing as the setting
#       below, which for me is an unused and unconnected secondary NIC.  TEST!
FLAT_INTERFACE=eth1
# Set this to an unused subset of the real IP space attached to the HOST_IP_IFACE
